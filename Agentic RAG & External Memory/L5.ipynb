Two of these cases involved ACORN suing Governor Jim Edgar under the new Motor Voter Act,[78][79] one involved a voter suing Mayor Daley under the Voting Rights Act,[80] and one involved, in the only case Obama orally argued, a whistleblowing stockbroker suing his former employer.[81]\\nAll of these appeals were resolved in favor of Obama's clients, with all the opinions authored by Obama's University of Chicago colleague Chief Judge Richard Posner.[82]\\nObama was a founding member of the board of directors of Public Allies in 1992, resigning before his wife, Michelle, became the founding executive director of Public Allies Chicago in early 1993.[55][83] From sixth grade through eighth grade at Punahou, Obama lived with his mother and Maya.[35][36]\\nObama's mother completed her coursework at the University of Hawaii for an M.A. in anthropology in December 1974.[37] After three years in Hawaii, she and Maya returned to Jakarta in August 1975,[38] where Dunham completed her contract with the Institute of Management Education and Development and started anthropological fieldwork.[39]\\nObama chose to stay with his grandparents in Honolulu to continue his studies at Punahou School for his high school years.[8][40]\\n In the summer of 1981, Obama traveled to Jakarta to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of Occidental College friends in Hyderabad (India) and Karachi (Pakistan) for three weeks.[49]\\nHe then transferred to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a speciality in international relations[50][51] and in English literature.[52] Obama lived off campus in a modest rented apartment at 142 West 109th Street.[53][54]\"},\n",

Would Altman’s vision lead to a world in which AI could do things beyond the imaginings of many in the early 2020s, or would it unleash capacity that could be used to the detriment of humanity? By the time Altman stepped down as president in 2019, Y Combinator had helped about 1,900 companies, among them the room-rental service Airbnb, the delivery companies Instacart and DoorDash, the forum site Reddit, and the streaming platform Twitch.\\\\n “Growing up gay in the Midwest in the 2000s was not the most awesome thing,” he said in a New Yorker interview in 2016.\\\\n'}, {'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/history-openai-sam-altman-9035175/', 'content': 'Therefore, in 2019, “OpenAI ‘transitioned’ into two organisations: a ‘capped-profit’ organisation called OpenAI Global LLC (in which the return on any investment was capped at 100 times the original amount); and OpenAI Inc, the non-profit sole controlling shareholder in OpenAI Global LLC,” wrote John Naughton, an Irish academic, journalist and author, in his recent article published by The Guardian.\\\\n The announcement came just hours after OpenAI’s board of directors said Altman would not be returning to his job and Emmett Shear, the former chief executive of Twitch, will replace Mira Murati as interim chief executive of the OpenAI.\\\\n According to a media report, members like Ilya Sutskever, an AI researcher and one of the co-founders of OpenAI, were increasingly worried about the potential dangers that the company’s technology posed to society. Sutskever banded together with other board members including Adam D’Angelo (CEO of Q&amp;A forum Quora), Tasha McCauley (entrepreneur), and Helen Toner (an AI safety researcher at Georgetown University) and sacked Altman, who was also on the board but didn’t have the majority to overturn the decision.
